🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git  
  cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
  
Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt  


⚡ Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data and train models:
  jupyter notebook


📈 Results
Our best model achieved an accuracy of 83.064%, with:
  Precision: 0.91
  Recall: 0.92
Precision ensures fewer false positives, while recall ensures that most fraudulent transactions are detected.
